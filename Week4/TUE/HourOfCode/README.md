Today's hour of code: 
==================
Write pseudocode that solves the following problems.  
You need to do two of the three questions, you can decide which two you want to do. If you want to do the third one it's up to you, but it's for extra credit.
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
###### Question 1:<br>
Which digit appears most?<br>
Given a number, return the digit (single number) which appears most often in it. In case of a tie, return the highest number.

Input: 63332<br>
Output: 3

Input: 10000000<br>
Output: 0

Input: 123454321<br>
Output: 4

Input: -4443<br>
Output: 4
<br>

###### Question 2:<br>
Given a string s containing some parenthesis '(', ')', '[', ']' check that each opening parenthesis is also closed in the right order. The string can also have other text in it.

Input: s = "(hour)of[code]"<br>
Output: true

Input: s = "()text"<br>
Output: true

Input: s = "("<br><br>
Output: false

Input: s = "([)]"<br>
Output: false
<br>

###### Question 3: <br>
Reverse a number: given a number, reverse its digits.

Input: 1234<br>
Output: 4321

Input: 100000000<br>
Output: 1

Input: -321<br>
Output: -123


Good luck!
