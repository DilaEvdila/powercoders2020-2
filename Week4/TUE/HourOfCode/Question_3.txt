Question 3
==========
Reverse a number: given a number, reverse its digits.


test cases
==========
Input: 1234
Output: 4321

Input: 100000000
Output: 1

Input: -321
Output: -123



Constraints
===========
only integers allowed, also negative
has to be integer only, no string
leading 0 have to be removed



input = integer (positive or negative)
process = remove the last digit from the input number and add it to the output until the input number is gone
output = integer in reversed order (positive or negative)


Begin ReverseNumber
    Initialize input as integer 0
    Initialize inputArray as array []
    Initialize output as string ""
    Initialize temp as integer 0

    Prompt "Please input a number with several digits. Only integers are allowed" as input

    If input is not empty and is an integer
        Split input to inputArray where each digit of input is an item in inputArray

        If input starts with a dash (is negative)
            ouput = "-";
        End If.

        Begin Loop
            While length of inputArray >= 0
                temp = pop last item of inputArray
                If temp is a digit and > 0
                    output = output + temp 
                End If
            End While
        End Loop

        If output is not empty
            Display "The number in reverse " + output
        Else
            Display "There was a problem reversing your input. Please try again"
            Go back to line 41
        End If
    Else
        Go back to line 41
    End If

End ReverseNumber
