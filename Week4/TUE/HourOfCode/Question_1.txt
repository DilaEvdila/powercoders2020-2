Question 1
==========
Which digit appears most?
Given a number, return the digit (single number) which appears most often in it. In case of a tie, return the highest number.


test cases
==========
Input: 63332
Output: 3

Input: 10000000
Output: 0

Input: 123454321
Output: 4

Input: -4443
Output: 4


Constraints
===========
integers allowed, also negative (ignore and turn to positive)
has to be integer only, no string
if tie, bigger number wins



input = integer (positive or negatve)
process = check if integer, split to digits, loop through digits and incremenet counter
output = digit which appears most and is higher than its ties


Begin WhichDigitAppearsMost
    Initialize input as string ""
    Initialize inputArray as array []
    Initialize counter as array []
    Initialize output as integer 0
    Initialize temp as integer 0

    Prompt "Please input a number with several digits" as input

    If input is not empty
        Split input to inputArray where each character/digit of input is an item in inputArray

        Begin Loop
            Foreach item in inputArray
                If item is a digit
                    counter[item]++;
                End If
            End Foreach
        End Loop

        Sort counter by index (usually automatically)

        Begin Loop
            Foreach item in counter                
                If value of item >= temp
                    output = index of item
                End if
                temp = value of item
            End Foreach
        End Loop

        Display "The digit which most appears is " + output

    Else
        Go back to line 41
    End If

End WhichDigitAppearsMost
